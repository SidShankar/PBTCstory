       The War of Lebanon was the key motivator. This civil war accounted for an increase in fatherless children, poverty, and rates of illiteracy among women. There were fewer jobs, and the youth had much less infrastructure than their parents’ generation.

       Over the course of the center’s existence, Ms. Ziadeh has taken in both orphans and needy children off of the streets and into a safe and loving environment.

     </div>
     <div class="caption">
       Lebanon's public school system has not changed for many years (specifically from 1943 to present). Although many educators are extremely knowledgeable, they do not have the qualifications or the experience required in order to teach. As a result, Lebanese students are only able to get a sufficient education by attending private schools, a heavy financial burden on their families.
     </div>
     <div class="caption">
       Ms. Ziadeh, the director of the Home of Tripoli for Social Welfare, has made large strides in order to compensate for this lack of education. Every one of her children is enrolled in a private school and receives tutoring.</div>

        Although we put an emphasis on education and well-being, having fun is a key part of the organization. There is a playground, mini soccer field, computer game room, and garden at the center.

       In the future, PBTC plans on raising enough funds to renovate the play areas located within the center. The computers are extremely outdated, and the playground is rusting.
